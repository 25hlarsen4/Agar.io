# Comments to Evaluators:

This is the biggest part of our assignment and contains most of the code for our project.
This is where we did all of our drawing and updated the objects of the world and used the timing and
rules of the assignment to create the game.

IMPORTANT NOTE: To use the split functionality you need to click on the entry on the right side of the screen.
Then when the player is big enough you can hit the space bar to "split" the player in a way that follows the assignment
specifications.
