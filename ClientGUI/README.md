# Comments to Evaluators:

This is the biggest part of our assignment and contains most of the code for our project.
This is where we did all of our drawing and updated the objects of the world and used the timing and
rules of the assignment to create the game.

IMPORTANT NOTE: To use the split functionality you need to click on the entry on the right side of the screen before
using the space bar functionality.
While we do manually give the entry default focus, MAUI is known to have issues with this type of thing and it has rarely 
worked in our testing.
